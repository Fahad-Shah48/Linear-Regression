# Linear-Regression
As part of my internship with CodexCue, I worked on a Simple Linear Regression project aimed at predicting tips based on various dining-related factors. Below is a summary of the key methodologies and steps followed:

Dataset Overview: Utilized a clean dataset consisting of 244 records across 7 columns, with no missing values.

Data Preprocessing:

Removed duplicate entries.

Verified and confirmed the absence of null values.

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding to prepare data for modeling.

Created visualizations such as scatter plots and pair plots for exploratory data analysis.

Data Splitting:

Defined 'total_bill' as the independent variable and 'tip' as the dependent variable for initial modeling.

Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate generalization performance.

Model Building & Evaluation:

Implemented a Simple Linear Regression model.

Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

Extension to Multiple Linear Regression:

Incorporated all available features (6 independent variables) to build a Multiple Linear Regression model.

Reassessed the model's performance using the same evaluation metrics.

Polynomial Regression:

Applied Polynomial Features to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

Analyzed and compared the performance impact relative to linear models.

This project provided hands-on experience in applying linear regression techniques, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using real-world data.
